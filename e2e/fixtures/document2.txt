Document 2: JavaScript Evolution

JavaScript has evolved significantly over the years.
Modern JavaScript (ES6+) includes features like arrow functions, async/await, and modules.
However, JavaScript lacks built-in type checking, which can lead to runtime errors.

Comparison with TypeScript:
- JavaScript is dynamically typed
- TypeScript adds static types
- TypeScript requires compilation
- JavaScript runs directly in browsers
