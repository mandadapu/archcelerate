Document 1: Introduction to TypeScript

TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript.
It provides optional static typing, classes, and interfaces.
TypeScript code is transpiled to JavaScript, which can run anywhere JavaScript runs.

Benefits:
- Type safety at compile time
- Better IDE support and autocomplete
- Easier refactoring
- Improved code documentation
