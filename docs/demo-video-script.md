## Quick Start: Automated Demo Recording

### Option 1: Playwright for Automated Recording

```typescript
// scripts/record-demo.ts
import { chromium } from 'playwright'

async function recordDemo() {
  const browser = await chromium.launch({
    headless: false,
    args: ['--window-size=1920,1080']
  })

  const context = await browser.newContext({
    viewport: { width: 1920, height: 1080 },
    recordVideo: {
      dir: 'demos/',
      size: { width: 1920, height: 1080 }
    }
  })

  const page = await context.newPage()

  // Scene 1: Homepage
  await page.goto('http://localhost:3000')
  await page.waitForTimeout(3000)

  // Scene 2: Curriculum
  await page.goto('http://localhost:3000/curriculum')
  await page.waitForTimeout(2000)

  // Scroll slowly
  await page.evaluate(() => {
    window.scrollTo({ top: 1000, behavior: 'smooth' })
  })
  await page.waitForTimeout(3000)

  // Scene 3: Week 1 content
  await page.click('text=Week 1: LLM Fundamentals')
  await page.waitForTimeout(2000)

  // Scroll through content
  await page.evaluate(() => {
    window.scrollTo({ top: 2000, behavior: 'smooth' })
  })
  await page.waitForTimeout(5000)

  // Scene 4: Domains
  await page.goto('http://localhost:3000/domains')
  await page.waitForTimeout(3000)

  // Close
  await context.close()
  await browser.close()
}

recordDemo()
```

Run with:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/record-demo.ts
