# AI Architect Accelerator - Product Vision

## Mission

Transform software engineers into AI product builders through an intensive 12-week accelerator that combines theory, hands-on practice, and real-world project development.

## Vision Statement

**Build the definitive AI engineering curriculum that takes developers from zero to production-ready AI systems in 12 weeks.**

We believe that AI engineering is fundamentally different from traditional software engineering. Success requires mastering new paradigms: prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation, agent architectures, vector databases, and production AI system design. Our mission is to compress years of learning into a focused, project-based curriculum that produces job-ready AI engineers.

## Core Principles

### 1. **Learning by Building**
Every concept is taught through production-ready code examples. Students don't just learn theory—they build real AI systems they can deploy and showcase.

### 2. **Production-First Mindset**
Focus on what matters in production: cost optimization, latency management, error handling, monitoring, compliance, and scale. Academic exercises give way to enterprise-grade implementations.

### 3. **Progressive Complexity**
Start with fundamentals (LLM APIs, prompts, tokens) and build towards sophisticated systems (multi-agent coordination, enterprise compliance, disaster recovery). Each week builds on previous knowledge.

### 4. **Comprehensive Technical Depth**
No handwaving. Every concept includes:
- Simple explanations for quick understanding
- Detailed technical implementations with production code
- Real cost/performance metrics
- Best practices and common pitfalls

### 5. **Practical Over Theoretical**
Choose runnable code over academic papers. Choose cost analysis over algorithm complexity. Choose deployment guides over research surveys.
