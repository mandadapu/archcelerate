# AI Product Planning & Design

## Introduction

Building a successful AI product requires careful planning. This guide helps you design your capstone project from concept to implementation.

## Finding Your Project Idea

### Good AI Project Characteristics

**Criteria:**
- Solves a real problem
- Uses AI meaningfully (not just for hype)
- Achievable in ~20 hours
- Has measurable success metrics
- Interesting to you

### Brainstorming Questions

1. **What problems do you face daily?**
   - Email overload → AI email summarizer
   - Meeting notes → AI meeting assistant
   - Code documentation → AI doc generator

2. **What tasks are repetitive?**
   - Data entry → AI extraction tool
   - Report generation → AI report writer
   - Customer support → AI chatbot

3. **What interests you?**
   - Finance → AI investment advisor
   - Education → AI tutor
   - Health → AI symptom checker

## Project Scoping

### The MVP Framework

**Minimum Viable Product includes:**
- ONE core feature that works well
- Basic UI (doesn't need to be beautiful)
- Essential error handling
- Minimal documentation

**Avoid:**
- Feature creep
- Perfect UI/UX
- Supporting every edge case
- Building a "complete" product

### Example: AI Code Reviewer

**MVP Scope:**
```
✅ INCLUDE:
- Review single file PRs
- Detect 3 types of issues (security, bugs, style)
- Post GitHub PR comments
- Basic error handling

❌ EXCLUDE (for now):
- Multi-file context
- Learning from feedback
- Custom rules engine
- Slack integration
- Metrics dashboard
```

## Problem Definition

### Problem Statement Template

```
[Target User] struggles with [Problem] which leads to [Negative Outcome].

We will solve this by [Solution] which will [Positive Outcome].

Success looks like [Measurable Metric].
```

**Example:**
```
Software engineers struggle with inconsistent code review quality
which leads to bugs in production.

We will solve this by building an AI code reviewer that checks
every PR for common issues which will catch 80% of simple bugs
before human review.

Success looks like 50% reduction in bugs caught in QA.
```

## User Research

### Interview 5 Potential Users

**Questions to ask:**
1. Describe the last time you experienced [problem]
2. What did you do to solve it?
3. What was frustrating about that solution?
4. What would the ideal solution look like?
5. How much would you pay for that solution?

**Document findings:**
- Common pain points
- Current workarounds
- Must-have features
- Nice-to-have features

## Feature Prioritization

### MoSCoW Method

**Must Have:**
- Core AI functionality
- Basic UI
- Data persistence
- Authentication (if needed)

**Should Have:**
- Error handling
- Loading states
- Success feedback

**Could Have:**
- Advanced features
- Polish
- Optimizations

**Won't Have (this version):**
- Everything else

```

### Tech Stack Selection

**Criteria:**
- Familiar (reduces learning curve)
- Well-documented
- Good AI library support
- Easy deployment

**Example Stack:**
- Frontend: Next.js + TypeScript
- Backend: Next.js API routes
- Database: PostgreSQL (Supabase)
- AI: Anthropic Claude API
- Vector DB: Pinecone
- Deploy: Vercel

## Data Requirements

### What data do you need?

1. **Training/Fine-tuning data:**
   - Do you need custom training data?
   - Where will you get it?
   - How much do you need?

2. **Operational data:**
   - User data (auth, preferences)
   - Generated content
   - Feedback/analytics

3. **External data:**
   - APIs to integrate
   - Documents to index
   - Real-time data sources

## Success Metrics

### Define Before Building

**Usage Metrics:**
- Daily active users
- Queries per user
- Retention rate

**Quality Metrics:**
- User satisfaction (NPS)
- Task completion rate
- Response accuracy

**Business Metrics:**
- Cost per query
- Revenue (if applicable)
- User acquisition cost

**Example Metrics:**
```
Project: AI Study Buddy

Success = 
- 10+ daily active users
- 80%+ answer accuracy (user rated)
- <$0.10 cost per conversation
- 50%+ 7-day retention
```

## Risk Assessment

### Identify Risks Early

**Technical Risks:**
- LLM API reliability
- Cost overruns
- Performance issues
- Data privacy

**Product Risks:**
- Users don't need it
- Existing solutions better
- Too complex to use
- Can't demonstrate value

**Mitigation:**
- Start with MVP
- Set cost limits
- Early user testing
- Build in public

## Project Timeline

### Week-by-Week Plan

**Week 1: Setup & Core Feature**
- Set up project structure
- Implement main AI feature
- Basic UI

**Week 2: Testing & Polish**
- User testing
- Bug fixes
- Documentation
- Deploy

**Milestones:**
- Day 3: Working prototype

   - What it does
   - How to use it
   - Setup instructions

2. **Architecture:**
   - System design
   - Data flow
   - API docs
