# Observability Basics for AI Systems

## Introduction

Observability is the ability to understand the internal state of your system by examining its outputs. For AI systems, this is crucial because LLM behavior can be unpredictable and expensive.

## The Three Pillars of Observability

### 1. Logs
Structured records of events happening in your system:
- User queries and system responses
- Token usage and costs
- Error messages and stack traces
- Performance metrics

### 2. Metrics
Quantitative measurements over time:
- Request latency (P50, P95, P99)
- Token consumption rates
- Cost per request
- Error rates
- Cache hit rates

### 3. Traces
End-to-end request flows:
- User request → RAG retrieval → LLM call → Response
- Identifying bottlenecks
- Understanding dependencies
- Debugging failures

## Why Observability Matters for AI

**Cost Management**
- LLM API calls are expensive ($0.01-$0.60 per 1K tokens)
- Track spending per user, feature, and endpoint
- Identify cost optimization opportunities

**Quality Assurance**
- Monitor response quality
- Detect hallucinations and errors
- Track user satisfaction

**Performance**
- Identify slow queries
- Optimize retrieval pipelines
- Reduce latency

## Key Metrics to Track

```typescript
interface AISystemMetrics {
  // Latency
  responseTimeMs: number
  retrievalTimeMs: number
  llmTimeMs: number

  // Cost
  inputTokens: number
  outputTokens: number
  totalCost: number

  // Quality
  userFeedback: 'positive' | 'negative' | null
  hallucination: boolean

  // Context
  documentsRetrieved: number
  cacheHit: boolean
}
```

## Observability Tools

**Popular Platforms:**
- **LangSmith** - LangChain's observability platform
- **Weights & Biases** - ML experiment tracking
- **Helicone** - LLM observability and caching
- **Datadog / New Relic** - General APM with AI extensions

**Open Source:**
- **OpenTelemetry** - Vendor-neutral observability framework
- **Prometheus + Grafana** - Metrics and dashboards
- **Jaeger** - Distributed tracing

## Best Practices

1. **Log Everything** - You can't optimize what you don't measure
2. **Use Structured Logging** - JSON logs are easier to query
3. **Set Alerts** - Be notified of anomalies before users complain
4. **Track Costs** - Set budgets and alerts
5. **Monitor Quality** - Track user feedback and model outputs

## Next Steps

In the following lessons, you'll learn:
- How to implement monitoring in production
- Caching strategies to reduce costs
- Deploying AI systems reliably
