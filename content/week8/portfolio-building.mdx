   - Calendar link for calls

##Project Presentation

###Project Card Template

```typescript
interface ProjectCard {
  title: string
  tagline: string // One sentence
  thumbnail: string
  tags: string[] // ['AI', 'RAG', 'Next.js']
  liveUrl?: string
  githubUrl: string
  featured: boolean
}
```

**Example:**
```
Title: DevReview AI
Tagline: AI-powered code review that catches bugs before humans
Tags: AI, Code Quality, GitHub Integration
Links: [Live Demo] [GitHub] [Case Study]
```

###Case Study Structure

```markdown
# DevReview AI: Automated Code Review System

## The Problem
Software teams spend 5+ hours weekly on code reviews,
and still miss 30% of bugs.

## The Solution
AI-powered reviewer that analyzes PRs in real-time,
catching common bugs, security issues, and style problems.

## Tech Stack
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet for code analysis
- GitHub API for PR integration
- Next.js + TypeScript
- PostgreSQL for review history

## Key Features
1. Real-time PR analysis
2. Security vulnerability detection
3. Performance optimization suggestions
4. Learning from team feedback

## Technical Challenges

### Challenge 1: Context Window Limits
**Problem:** Large PRs exceeded context window

**Solution:** Implemented smart chunking...

## Impact
- 40% reduction in bugs reaching production
- 2 hours saved per developer per week
- 95% developer satisfaction

## What I Learned
- Prompt engineering for code analysis
- GitHub Actions integration
- Handling false positives

##Technical Writing

###Blog Post Ideas

- "Building a RAG System from Scratch"
- "5 Lessons from Deploying AI to Production"
- "How I Reduced LLM Costs by 80%"
- "Prompt Engineering Patterns That Actually Work"

###Writing Tips

1. **Start with why**: Why does this matter?
2. **Show code**: Code examples > theory
3. **Be specific**: "Reduced latency from 2s to 200ms" > "Made it faster"
4. **Tell stories**: Share failures and learnings
5. **Make it skimmable**: Headers, bullets, code blocks

##SEO Basics

```typescript
// Next.js metadata
export const metadata = {
  title: 'John Doe | AI Engineer',
  description: 'Building production AI applications with LLMs and RAG',
  keywords: ['AI Engineer', 'Machine Learning', 'RAG', 'LangChain'],
  openGraph: {
    title: 'John Doe - AI Engineer Portfolio',
    description: 'Production AI applications and technical writing',
    images: ['/og-image.jpg']
  }
}
```
