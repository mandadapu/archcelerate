# Marketing for Developers

##Marketing ≠ Spam

**Good marketing:**
- Solves real problems
- Provides value
- Teaches something
- Builds trust

**Bad marketing:**
- Generic pitches
- Feature dumps
- Empty hype
- Interruptive

##Marketing Channels

###1. Content Marketing

**Blog Posts:**
```
"How We Reduced Our LLM Costs by 80%"
→ Teaches a lesson
→ Shows your expertise
→ Natural product mention
```

**Tutorials:**
```
"Building a RAG System in 30 Minutes"
→ Provides value
→ Uses your product
→ Helps potential users
```

###2. Social Media

**Twitter Strategy:**
- Share learnings (not just announcements)
- Engage with community
- Post building in public updates
- Reply to relevant threads

**Example Tweets:**
```
✅ "Just shipped caching and reduced costs 80%.
   Here's what I learned about LLM optimization: 🧵"

❌ "Check out our amazing AI product! [link]"
```

###3. Community Engagement

**Where to Participate:**
- Reddit (r/MachineLearning, r/LocalLLaMA)
- Hacker News
- Discord communities
- Dev.to, Hashnode

**How to Add Value:**
- Answer questions
- Share experience
- Provide feedback
- Help others

###4. Email Marketing

**When to Start:**
- After first 100 users
- When you have updates to share
- When launching new features

**Email Types:**
- Weekly tips/tutorials
- Product updates
- User stories
- Feature announcements

##Building in Public

###What to Share

**Good:**
- Progress updates
- Lessons learned
- Metrics and milestones
- Technical challenges
- User feedback

**Example:**
```
Month 1 update:
- 127 users signed up
- 2,450 AI code reviews run
- Caught 89 real bugs
- $247 in LLM costs
- Learned: Users want GitHub Actions integration

Working on it this week! 
```

##Creating Content

###Blog Post Formula

**Structure:**
1. **Hook**: Interesting result or problem
2. **Story**: How you got there
3. **Solution**: What you built/learned
4. **Proof**: Results, metrics
5. **Takeaway**: Key lesson
6. **CTA**: Try it yourself

**Example:**
```markdown
# How I Reduced LLM Costs from $500 to $100/month

Last month, my AI app cost me $500 in API fees.
Today, it costs $100 and works better.

Here's what I changed:

[Story of discovery]
[Technical solution]
[Results with numbers]
[Lessons learned]

Try these techniques in your app: [link]
```

###Video Content

**Demo Videos:**
- 30-60 seconds
- Show problem → solution
- Real use case
- No fluff

**Tutorial Videos:**
- 5-10 minutes
- Step-by-step walkthrough
- Screen recording + voiceover
- Link to written guide

##SEO Basics for Developers

###On-Page SEO

```typescript
// Good SEO
export const metadata = {
  title: 'AI Code Reviewer | DevReview',
  description: 'Catch bugs before code review with AI-powered PR analysis. Integrates with GitHub in 2 minutes.',
  keywords: ['AI code review', 'GitHub integration', 'automated code review']
}

// Bad SEO
export const metadata = {
  title: 'Home',
  description: 'Welcome to our site'
}
```

###Content SEO

**Target Long-Tail Keywords:**
- "how to build RAG system"
- "Claude API cost optimization"
- "AI code review GitHub"

**Write for Humans First:**
- Solve real problems
- Provide actionable advice
- Use examples and code

##Measuring Marketing

###Track Everything

```typescript
// UTM parameters
const signupLink = `https://yourapp.com/signup?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=launch`

// Analytics
interface MarketingMetrics {
  source: string
  visitors: number
  signups: number
  conversionRate: number
  cost: number
  roi: number
}
```

###Key Metrics

- **Traffic sources**: Where users come from
- **Conversion rate**: Visitors → signups
- **CAC**: Cost to acquire customer
- **Viral coefficient**: Users who refer others

##Common Mistakes

1. **Broadcasting instead of engaging**
2. **Talking features, not benefits**
3. **Ignoring existing audience**
4. **Inconsistent content**
5. **No clear differentiation**
