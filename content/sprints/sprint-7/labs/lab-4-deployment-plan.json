Deployment Strategy:\n   - Choose strategy based on risk tolerance\n   - Document rollout steps\n\n3. Monitoring Setup:\n   - Error tracking tool (Sentry)\n   - LLM metrics to track (tokens, cost, latency)\n   - Uptime monitoring (UptimeRobot)\n   - Alert thresholds\n\n4. Launch Plan:\n   - Timeline (T-24h, T-1h, launch, T+1h, T+24h)\n   - Launch channels (Product Hunt, Twitter, etc.)\n   - Content prepared (posts, demo video)\n\n5. Rollback Procedure:\n   - When to rollback\n   - Step-by-step rollback process\n\n6. Post-Launch:\n   - Week 1 priorities (fix bugs, optimize costs)\n   - Optimization strategies",
