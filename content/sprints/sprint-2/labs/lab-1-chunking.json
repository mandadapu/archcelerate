  "starterCode": "/**\n * Chunk a document into optimal segments\n * @param {string} text - The input text to chunk\n * @param {number} chunkSize - Target chunk size in characters\n * @param {number} overlap - Overlap between chunks in characters\n * @returns {string[]} - Array of text chunks\n */\nfunction chunkDocument(text, chunkSize = 500, overlap = 50) {\n  // Your code here\n  return []\n}\n",
  "instructions": "Implement the `chunkDocument` function that:\n1. Splits text into chunks of approximately `chunkSize` characters\n2. Maintains `overlap` characters between consecutive chunks\n3. Avoids splitting in the middle of words\n4. Returns an array of chunk strings\n\nExample:\nchunkDocument('The quick brown fox...', 20, 5)\n// Should return chunks with ~20 chars each, 5 char overlap",
