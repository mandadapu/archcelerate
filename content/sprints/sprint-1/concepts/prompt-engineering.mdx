# Prompt Engineering Basics

Prompt engineering is the art and science of crafting inputs that get the best outputs from LLMs. A well-designed prompt can mean the difference between a mediocre response and an exceptional one.

## Why Prompting Matters

LLMs are incredibly capable, but they need clear instructions. Think of prompting like:
- Writing a clear email to a colleague
- Giving directions to someone unfamiliar with your city
- Briefing a team member on a task

The better your input, the better the output.

## The Anatomy of a Good Prompt

A well-structured prompt typically includes:

1. **Role/Context**: Who should the model be?
2. **Task**: What do you want it to do?
3. **Format**: How should the output be structured?
4. **Constraints**: What should it avoid or include?
5. **Examples**: Show what you want (few-shot)

## Basic Prompting Techniques

### 1. Be Specific

**Vague:**
```
Tell me about JavaScript
```

**Specific:**
```
Explain JavaScript closures to a developer
who understands functions but hasn't used
closures before. Include a practical example.
```

### 2. Use Clear Formatting

```
Task: Analyze this code for security issues

Code:
```javascript
app.get('/user/:id', (req, res) => {
  const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${req.params.id}`
  db.query(query)
})
```

Format your response as:
1. Issue type
2. Severity (low/medium/high)
3. Fix recommendation
```

### 3. Provide Examples (Few-Shot Learning)

```
Convert these sentences to questions:

Sentence: The sky is blue.
Question: What color is the sky?

Sentence: Paris is the capital of France.
Question: What is the capital of France?

Sentence: Water boils at 100°C.
Question:
```

The model will follow the pattern.

## Advanced Techniques

### Chain of Thought (CoT)

Asking the model to "think step by step" improves reasoning:

```
Problem: A store has 15 apples. They sell 8
and receive a delivery of 12. How many apples
do they have?

Think through this step by step:
```

### Role Prompting

```
You are a senior software architect reviewing
code for a financial application. Focus on:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance issues
- Maintainability concerns

Review this code...
```

### Constrained Output

```
Summarize this article in exactly 3 bullet
points, each under 20 words. Use simple language
suitable for a 10th grader.
```

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Ambiguous Instructions

**Bad:** "Make this better"
**Good:** "Refactor this function to improve readability by extracting the validation logic"

### 2. Conflicting Requirements

**Bad:** "Write a brief, comprehensive guide"
**Good:** "Write a 500-word overview covering the 3 main concepts"

### 3. Assuming Context

LLMs don't remember previous conversations unless you include them. Always provide necessary context.

## System Prompts vs User Prompts

In API usage, you often have two prompt types:

**System Prompt**: Sets the AI's overall behavior
```
You are a helpful AI coding assistant.
You provide concise, correct code examples.
You explain your reasoning.
```

**User Prompt**: The specific task
```
Write a Python function to validate email addresses
```

## Prompt Templates

Create reusable templates for common tasks:

```
Code Review Template:
---
Role: Senior [LANGUAGE] developer
Task: Review this code for [FOCUS_AREAS]
Code: [CODE]
Format:
- Issues found (if any)
- Suggestions for improvement
- Positive aspects
```

## Testing and Iteration

Good prompting is iterative:

1. **Start simple**: Get a baseline response
2. **Identify gaps**: What's missing or wrong?
3. **Refine**: Add specificity, examples, or constraints
4. **Test variations**: Try different phrasings
5. **Document**: Save prompts that work well

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Code Generation

**Iteration 1:**
```
Write a function to sort an array
```

**Iteration 2:**
```
Write a TypeScript function that:
- Takes an array of objects with 'name' and 'age' properties
- Sorts by age (ascending)
- Returns a new array (don't mutate)
- Include type definitions
```

### Example 2: Debugging Help

**Poor:**
```
My code doesn't work
```

**Better:**
```
I'm getting "TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined"
in this React component:

[code here]

Expected: List of users should render
Actual: Error on line 23
What's wrong?
```

## Lab: Prompt Engineering Practice

Try improving these prompts:

1. "Explain databases"
2. "Fix my code"
3. "What's the best programming language?"

<details>
<summary>Sample Improvements</summary>

1. "Explain relational databases to a web developer familiar with JSON. Cover: tables, relationships, and when to use SQL vs NoSQL. Use 200 words."

2. "This Python function should return the sum of even numbers in a list, but it's returning None. Here's the code: [code]. What's the bug and how do I fix it?"

3. "Compare Python and JavaScript for building a REST API with a small team. Consider: learning curve, ecosystem, performance, and deployment options."

</details>

## Token Optimization

Since API calls cost money based on tokens:

**Verbose (wasteful):**
```
Please help me by providing a very detailed
explanation of how I might go about implementing...
```

**Concise:**
```
Explain how to implement [specific task] with code example.
```

## Key Takeaways

- Specificity and structure dramatically improve outputs
- Examples teach the model your desired format
- Iteration is key—refine based on results
- Context and constraints guide the model effectively
- System prompts set behavior, user prompts define tasks

## Best Practices Checklist

- [ ] Is the task clearly stated?
- [ ] Is the expected format specified?
- [ ] Are examples provided (if needed)?
- [ ] Is the context sufficient?
- [ ] Are constraints explicit?
- [ ] Is the prompt concise yet complete?

## Next Steps

Now that you can craft effective prompts, you're ready to build your first AI application: a **Chat Assistant** that uses these prompting techniques in production.
