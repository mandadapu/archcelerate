# Zero-Exposure Proxy Pattern for Healthcare AI

*A rock-solid security posture for platforms handling sensitive medical data.*

---

## The Core Idea

In this architecture, the mobile app is a "dumb" client regarding infrastructure — it knows how to format data, but it has no idea where the "real" storage (S3/HealthLake) actually lives. By implementing **Certificate Pinning** and a **Hardened API Proxy**, you effectively eliminate the two biggest mobile vulnerabilities: Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks and credential leakage.

## 1. The "Zero-Exposure" Proxy Pattern

Since your apps only talk to your backend, your API Gateway/BFF (Backend-for-Frontend) acts as a security air-gap:

**Credential Isolation:** The S3 and FHIR IAM roles/access keys live exclusively in your AWS Secret Manager or are attached to the EC2/Lambda execution role. The mobile app never sees an AWS Signature or an API Key.

**Certificate Pinning:** By hardcoding the server's public key (or hash) into the app, you ensure it only talks to your specific backend instance. Even if a user installs a malicious root certificate on their device, the app will refuse to connect to a proxy.

**Network Perimeter:** Your FHIR server and S3 buckets can stay in a Private Subnet with no public IP, accessible only via your API service's VPC endpoint.

## 2. Controlled External Connectivity

Limiting the "Outside World" to only Google Analytics and Crashlytics is a classic strategy for minimizing the attack surface.

**Analytics/Crashlytics:** These are strictly for telemetry and stability.

**Data Sovereignty:** By proxying the clinical data (FHIR), you ensure that no PII (Personally Identifiable Information) ever accidentally leaks to a third-party SDK, as the "real" medical payload only travels through your pinned tunnel.

## 3. Implementation for Security-First AI Architecture

This is a textbook case study for the "Untrusted Client" design principle — the phone can never be trusted with infrastructure secrets.

| Security Risk | Solution |
|---|---|
| Credential Theft | Proxy Service (App never sees S3/FHIR keys) |
| MITM / Proxy Tools | Certificate Pinning (Blocks tools like Charles Proxy/Burp Suite) |
| Data Scraping | Rate Limiting and Identity-Aware Proxying at the Backend |
| Side-Channel Leaks | Strict outbound allow-listing (Only Analytics/Crashlytics) |

## Key Takeaways

- **Never expose infrastructure credentials to mobile clients** — treat every device as a potentially compromised endpoint
- **Certificate pinning** is your first line of defense against MITM attacks, even on devices with malicious root certificates installed
- **Private subnets with VPC endpoints** ensure clinical data stores have zero public internet exposure
- **Outbound allow-listing** prevents accidental PII leakage to third-party SDKs
- The "dumb client" pattern isn't a limitation — it's a deliberate security architecture that keeps sensitive medical data exactly where it belongs
