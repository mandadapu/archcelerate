# Multi-Agent Coordination Patterns

## Why Multi-Agent Systems?

**Simple Explanation**: Just like a company needs different specialists (marketing, engineering, sales), complex AI tasks often need different "specialist" agents working together. A single AI agent trying to do everything is like asking one person to run an entire company.

**When You Need Multiple Agents**:
1. **Task Complexity**: The task requires multiple distinct skills (research + writing + coding)
2. **Parallel Processing**: Different parts can be done simultaneously to save time
3. **Specialization**: Each agent optimized for specific capabilities
4. **Reliability**: If one agent fails, others can continue or compensate

**Real Example**: Building a blog post about a technical topic
- **Researcher Agent**: Finds latest information and sources
- **Writer Agent**: Creates engaging content from research
- **Fact Checker Agent**: Verifies claims and statistics
- **SEO Agent**: Optimizes for search engines

## Core Concepts

### Agent Roles & Capabilities

**Simple Explanation**: Think of agents as specialists with specific skills. A researcher agent knows how to search and analyze, while a writer agent knows how to create compelling content.

```typescript
interface Agent {
  role: string          // What the agent does
  capabilities: string[] // Skills/tools it can use
  execute: (task: Task) => Promise<Result>
}

// Example: Research specialist
const researcher: Agent = {
  role: 'researcher',
  capabilities: ['web_search', 'document_analysis', 'data_extraction'],
  execute: async (task) => {
    // Specialized research logic
    const sources = await webSearch(task.query)
    const analysis = await analyzeDocuments(sources)
    return {
      findings: analysis,
      sources: sources,
      confidence: 0.85
    }
  }
}

// Example: Writer specialist
const writer: Agent = {
  role: 'writer',
  capabilities: ['content_generation', 'summarization', 'editing'],
  execute: async (task) => {
    const prompt = `Write a ${task.style} article about:
    ${task.topic}

    Using this research:
    ${task.context}

    Target audience: ${task.audience}`

    const response = await anthropic.messages.create({
      model: 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022',
      max_tokens: 2000,
      messages: [{ role: 'user', content: prompt }]
    })

    return {
      content: response.content[0].text,
      wordCount: response.content[0].text.split(' ').length
    }
  }
}

// Example: Coder specialist
const coder: Agent = {
  role: 'coder',
  capabilities: ['code_generation', 'debugging', 'testing'],
  execute: async (task) => {
    const code = await generateCode(task.requirements)
    const tests = await generateTests(code)
    const bugs = await analyzeCode(code)

    return {
      code,
      tests,
      issues: bugs,
      tested: bugs.length === 0
    }
  }
}
```

**Technical Details**:
- **Role Definition**: Clear responsibilities prevent overlap
- **Capability Registry**: Allows dynamic agent selection based on task requirements
- **Stateless vs Stateful**: Stateless agents are easier to scale, stateful remember context
- **Cost**: Each agent call costs separately - plan carefully!

**Architect's Tip — Supervisor vs. Choreography (The Orchestration Decision)**: "Every multi-agent system faces the same architectural fork: **Supervisor** (Hub-and-Spoke) or **Choreography** (Event-Driven). A Supervisor has one coordinator that dispatches tasks and collects results — it's easy to reason about but creates a single point of failure and a bottleneck. Choreography has agents react to events from each other — it scales better but is harder to debug because there's no central log of 'who did what.' An Architect picks Supervisor for **transactional workflows** where you need rollback capability (refund processing, compliance audits), and Choreography for **streaming pipelines** where throughput matters more than consistency (content generation, monitoring)."

```typescript
/**
 * Supervisor vs. Choreography: The Orchestration Decision
 *
 * SUPERVISOR (Hub-and-Spoke):
 * ✅ Central control — easy to debug, audit, and rollback
 * ✅ Single orchestrator knows full workflow state
 * ✅ Natural fit for transactional workflows
 * ❌ Single point of failure (supervisor crash = full stop)
 * ❌ Bottleneck at high concurrency (all agents report to one node)
 *
 * CHOREOGRAPHY (Event-Driven):
 * ✅ No single point of failure — agents react independently
 * ✅ Scales horizontally (add agents without changing coordinator)
 * ✅ Natural fit for streaming/pipeline workloads
 * ❌ Hard to debug (no central "who did what" log)
 * ❌ Circular event loops can emerge silently
 *
 * Interview Defense: "We use Supervisor for compliance-sensitive
 * workflows where we need audit trails and rollback. We use
 * Choreography for content pipelines where throughput matters
 * more than transactional guarantees."
 */

type OrchestrationModel = 'supervisor' | 'choreography'

interface OrchestrationDecision {
  workflow: string
  needsRollback: boolean
  needsAuditTrail: boolean
  agentCount: number
  throughputCritical: boolean
  concurrentUsers: number
}

function selectOrchestrationModel(
  config: OrchestrationDecision
): { model: OrchestrationModel; reasoning: string } {
  // Rule 1: Transactional workflows always use Supervisor
  if (config.needsRollback || config.needsAuditTrail) {
    return {
      model: 'supervisor',
      reasoning: `Workflow "${config.workflow}" requires ${
        config.needsRollback ? 'rollback' : 'audit trail'
      } — Supervisor provides central state tracking`
    }
  }

  // Rule 2: High concurrency + throughput → Choreography
  if (config.throughputCritical && config.concurrentUsers > 100) {
    return {
      model: 'choreography',
      reasoning: `${config.concurrentUsers} concurrent users with throughput priority — Choreography avoids supervisor bottleneck`
    }
  }

  // Rule 3: Small agent count → Supervisor (simpler)
  if (config.agentCount <= 4) {
    return {
      model: 'supervisor',
      reasoning: `Only ${config.agentCount} agents — Supervisor overhead is minimal, debugging is easier`
    }
  }

  // Default: Choreography for large, non-transactional systems
  return {
    model: 'choreography',
    reasoning: `${config.agentCount} agents without transactional requirements — Choreography scales better`
  }
}

// Decision matrix:
//
// | Workflow              | Rollback? | Audit? | Agents | Model         |
// |-----------------------|-----------|--------|--------|---------------|
// | Refund processing     | Yes       | Yes    | 3      | Supervisor    |
// | Content generation    | No        | No     | 6      | Choreography  |
// | Compliance audit      | No        | Yes    | 4      | Supervisor    |
// | Real-time monitoring  | No        | No     | 8      | Choreography  |
// | Invoice approval      | Yes       | Yes    | 3      | Supervisor    |
```

## Orchestration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Sequential Workflow (Pipeline)

**Simple Explanation**: Agents work one after another, like an assembly line. The output of one agent becomes the input for the next.

**When to Use**:
- Output of one agent is needed as input for the next
- Tasks have dependencies (can't write before researching)
- Need to maintain quality through staged review

```typescript
async function sequentialWorkflow(topic: string) {
  console.log('Starting sequential workflow for:', topic)

  // Stage 1: Research (0-30 seconds)
  console.log('Stage 1: Research...')
  const research = await agents.researcher.execute({
    type: 'research',
    query: topic,
    depth: 'comprehensive'
  })
  console.log(`✓ Found ${research.sources.length} sources`)

  // Stage 2: Outline (5-10 seconds)
  console.log('Stage 2: Outline...')
  const outline = await agents.writer.execute({
    type: 'outline',
    context: research.findings,
    format: 'blog_post'
  })
  console.log(`✓ Created ${outline.sections.length} sections`)

  // Stage 3: Write (20-40 seconds)
  console.log('Stage 3: Writing...')
  const draft = await agents.writer.execute({
    type: 'write',
    outline: outline,
    context: research.findings,
    style: 'professional'
  })
  console.log(`✓ Wrote ${draft.wordCount} words`)

  // Stage 4: Review (10-15 seconds)
  console.log('Stage 4: Review...')
  const review = await agents.reviewer.execute({
    type: 'review',
    content: draft.content,
    criteria: ['accuracy', 'clarity', 'engagement']
  })

  // Stage 5: Revise if needed (15-30 seconds)
  if (review.needsRevision) {
    console.log('Stage 5: Revising...')
    const final = await agents.writer.execute({
      type: 'revise',
      content: draft.content,
      feedback: review.suggestions
    })
    return final
  }

  return draft
}

// Usage
const blogPost = await sequentialWorkflow('AI Agent Coordination Patterns')
// Total time: 50-125 seconds
// Total cost: ~$0.15-0.30 (depending on content length)
```

**Performance Metrics**:
- **Total Time**: 50-125 seconds (sum of all stages)
- **Parallelization**: None (must be sequential)
- **Cost**: 5 agent calls × $0.03-0.06 = $0.15-0.30 per workflow
- **Quality**: Highest (each stage reviews previous)

### Pattern 2: Parallel Workflow (Fan-Out/Fan-In)

**Simple Explanation**: Multiple agents work at the same time on different parts, then combine results. Like having multiple researchers each investigating different aspects simultaneously.

**When to Use**:
- Tasks can be split into independent parts
- Speed is critical (want to minimize total time)
- Different perspectives improve quality

```typescript
async function parallelWorkflow(task: string) {
  console.log('Starting parallel workflow for:', task)

  // Fan-Out: Multiple agents work simultaneously
  const startTime = Date.now()

  const [research, examples, references, competitors] = await Promise.all([
    // Agent 1: General research (30s)
    agents.researcher.execute({
      type: 'research',
      query: task,
      focus: 'general_overview'
    }),

    // Agent 2: Code examples (25s)
    agents.coder.execute({
      type: 'examples',
      query: task,
      language: 'typescript'
    }),

    // Agent 3: Academic references (35s)
    agents.librarian.execute({
      type: 'references',
      query: task,
      sources: ['arxiv', 'papers_with_code']
    }),

    // Agent 4: Competitor analysis (40s)
    agents.analyst.execute({
      type: 'competitor_analysis',
      topic: task
    })
  ])

  const fanOutTime = Date.now() - startTime
  console.log(`✓ Parallel execution completed in ${fanOutTime}ms`)

  // Fan-In: Coordinator synthesizes all results
  const synthesis = await agents.coordinator.execute({
    type: 'synthesize',
    inputs: {
      research: research.findings,
      codeExamples: examples.code,
      academicSources: references.papers,
      marketAnalysis: competitors.insights
    }
  })

  const totalTime = Date.now() - startTime
  console.log(`✓ Total workflow: ${totalTime}ms`)

  return {
    content: synthesis,
    metadata: {
      parallelTime: fanOutTime,
      totalTime: totalTime,
      speedup: '3.5x compared to sequential'
    }
  }
}

// Performance comparison
// Sequential: 30 + 25 + 35 + 40 = 130 seconds
// Parallel: max(30, 25, 35, 40) = 40 seconds + 5s synthesis = 45 seconds
// Speedup: 2.9x faster!
```

**Performance Metrics**:
- **Total Time**: 45 seconds (longest agent + synthesis)
- **Speedup**: 2-4x compared to sequential
- **Cost**: Same as sequential (same number of calls)
- **Tradeoff**: Less quality control between stages

### Pattern 3: Hierarchical Coordination (Manager-Worker)

**Simple Explanation**: One "manager" agent breaks down complex tasks and delegates to "worker" agents, then combines their results. Like a project manager coordinating a team.

```typescript
class ManagerAgent {
  private workers: Map<string, Agent>

  constructor(workers: Agent[]) {
    this.workers = new Map(workers.map(w => [w.role, w]))
  }

  async delegateTask(complexTask: ComplexTask) {
    // Step 1: Analyze and decompose the task
    const decomposition = await this.decomposeTask(complexTask)
    console.log(`Decomposed into ${decomposition.subtasks.length} subtasks`)

    // Step 2: Create execution plan
    const plan = this.createExecutionPlan(decomposition)
    console.log(`Execution plan:`, plan)

    // Step 3: Assign subtasks to appropriate workers
    const assignments = plan.subtasks.map(subtask => ({
      subtask,
      agent: this.selectBestAgent(subtask.requirements)
    }))

    // Step 4: Execute with proper coordination
    const results = []
    for (const assignment of assignments) {
      if (assignment.subtask.dependencies.length === 0) {
        // No dependencies, can run immediately
        results.push(assignment.agent.execute(assignment.subtask))
      } else {
        // Has dependencies, wait for them
        const dependencyResults = results.filter((_, i) =>
          assignment.subtask.dependencies.includes(i)
        )
        await Promise.all(dependencyResults)
        results.push(assignment.agent.execute(assignment.subtask))
      }
    }

    const completedResults = await Promise.all(results)

    // Step 5: Synthesize and validate
    const synthesized = await this.synthesize(completedResults)
    const validated = await this.validate(synthesized, complexTask.requirements)

    return validated
  }

  private async decomposeTask(task: ComplexTask) {
    // Use LLM to intelligently break down the task
    const response = await anthropic.messages.create({
      model: 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022',
      max_tokens: 1500,
      messages: [{
        role: 'user',
        content: `Decompose this complex task into subtasks:

Task: ${task.description}
Requirements: ${JSON.stringify(task.requirements)}
Available agents: ${Array.from(this.workers.keys()).join(', ')}

Return JSON array of subtasks with:
- description: what needs to be done
- assignTo: which agent should do it
- dependencies: array of subtask indices this depends on
- estimatedTime: seconds`
      }]
    })

    return JSON.parse(response.content[0].text)
  }

  private selectBestAgent(requirements: string[]): Agent {
    // Score each agent based on capability match
    const scores = Array.from(this.workers.entries()).map(([role, agent]) => {
      const matchScore = requirements.filter(req =>
        agent.capabilities.includes(req)
      ).length
      return { agent, score: matchScore }
    })

    // Return agent with highest score
    return scores.sort((a, b) => b.score - a.score)[0].agent
  }

  private async synthesize(results: Result[]) {
    // Combine all results into coherent output
    const combined = await anthropic.messages.create({
      model: 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022',
      max_tokens: 2000,
      messages: [{
        role: 'user',
        content: `Synthesize these agent results into a coherent output:

${results.map((r, i) => `Result ${i + 1}: ${JSON.stringify(r)}`).join('\n\n')}`
      }]
    })

    return combined.content[0].text
  }
}

// Example usage
const manager = new ManagerAgent([
  researcher,
  writer,
  coder,
  reviewer,
  analyst
])

const result = await manager.delegateTask({
  description: 'Create a comprehensive guide on building AI agents with code examples',
  requirements: [
    'research current best practices',
    'provide working code examples',
    'explain tradeoffs',
    'include performance metrics'
  ]
})
```

**Why This Works**:
- **Intelligent Decomposition**: LLM breaks down complex tasks appropriately
- **Dynamic Assignment**: Best agent chosen based on capabilities
- **Dependency Management**: Ensures proper execution order
- **Quality Control**: Manager validates final output

## Communication Patterns

### Shared Memory

```typescript
class SharedMemory {
  private store = new Map<string, any>()

  async write(key: string, value: any, metadata?: any) {
    this.store.set(key, {
      value,
      metadata,
      timestamp: Date.now(),
      version: (this.store.get(key)?.version || 0) + 1
    })
  }

  async read(key: string) {
    return this.store.get(key)?.value
  }

  async subscribe(key: string, callback: (value: any) => void) {
    // Notify callback when key changes
    // Implementation depends on your event system
  }
}

// Agents share findings through memory
const memory = new SharedMemory()

// Agent 1 writes findings
await memory.write('research_findings', researchResults)

// Agent 2 reads and builds on it
const findings = await memory.read('research_findings')
const article = await writeArticle(findings)
```

### Message Passing

```typescript
class MessageBus {
  private subscribers = new Map<string, Function[]>()

  subscribe(topic: string, handler: Function) {
    if (!this.subscribers.has(topic)) {
      this.subscribers.set(topic, [])
    }
    this.subscribers.get(topic)!.push(handler)
  }

  async publish(topic: string, message: any) {
    const handlers = this.subscribers.get(topic) || []
    await Promise.all(handlers.map(h => h(message)))
  }
}

// Usage
const bus = new MessageBus()

// Agent subscribes to events
bus.subscribe('research_complete', async (data) => {
  console.log('Starting writing based on research...')
  await writer.execute({ type: 'write', context: data })
})

// Another agent publishes event
await bus.publish('research_complete', researchResults)
```

**Architect's Tip — Selective Context Summarization (The Egress Hand-off)**: "The #1 hidden cost in multi-agent systems is **context bloat**. When Agent A passes its full 8,000-token output to Agent B, and Agent B passes its 10,000-token output to Agent C, you're paying for 18,000 tokens of context that Agent C doesn't need. An Architect enforces an **Egress Hand-off** — each agent summarizes its output into a **500-token structured handoff** before passing to the next agent. This cuts inter-agent token costs by 87% and actually improves downstream quality because the receiving agent isn't distracted by irrelevant details."

```typescript
/**
 * Selective Context Summarization (Egress Hand-off)
 *
 * Problem: Agent A produces 8,000 tokens. Agent B receives all 8,000
 * plus its own prompt (2,000 tokens). Agent C receives A's 8,000 +
 * B's 10,000 + its own prompt. By Agent D, you're at 35,000+ tokens
 * of context — most of which is irrelevant noise.
 *
 * Cost: At $0.003/1K input tokens, a 4-agent chain costs $0.174
 * per request in context alone. At 100K requests/month = $17,400.
 *
 * Solution: Each agent produces a structured 500-token "Egress Summary"
 * before handing off. Downstream agents receive ONLY the summary,
 * not the full working context.
 *
 * Result: 4-agent chain drops from 58,000 to 7,500 input tokens.
 * Monthly cost: $2,250 (87% reduction). Quality improves because
 * downstream agents focus on relevant signals.
 *
 * Interview Defense: "We enforce Egress Hand-offs between agents.
 * Each agent summarizes its output into 500 tokens before passing
 * downstream. This cut our inter-agent token costs by 87% and
 * actually improved task accuracy by 12% because downstream
 * agents weren't distracted by irrelevant context."

interface EgressSummary {
  agentId: string
  taskCompleted: string        // What this agent did (1 sentence)

//   Agent D input:  500 + 2,000 = 2,500 tokens

//   Cost at $0.003/1K: $0.023 per request
//   Monthly (100K requests): $2,250
//
// Savings: $15,150/month (87% reduction)
// Quality: +12% accuracy (less noise in context)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Role Definition**: Each agent should have a specific, well-defined purpose
2. **Avoid Over-Coordination**: Too much coordination overhead defeats the purpose
3. **Handle Failures Gracefully**: One agent failure shouldn't break the entire system
4. **Monitor Costs**: Multi-agent systems can get expensive quickly
5. **Use Caching**: Many agents may need the same information
6. **Set Timeouts**: Prevent one slow agent from blocking everything

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Too Many Agents**: More agents ≠ better results. Start simple.
   - **Bad**: 10 agents for a simple task → $5 in API calls
   - **Good**: 2-3 agents for complex task → $0.30 in API calls

2. **Circular Dependencies**: Agent A waits for B, B waits for A
   - **Fix**: Use dependency graphs, validate before execution

**Architect's Tip — DAG-Based Workflow Validation (The Cycle Detector)**: "Never execute a multi-agent workflow without first parsing it into a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** and validating it. A circular dependency between agents is a **silent deadlock** — Agent A waits for B, B waits for C, C waits for A, and your system hangs forever with no error message. An Architect validates the DAG before the first agent fires. If a cycle is detected, it's a **hard stop** — no execution, immediate error to the developer. This costs 0.1ms and prevents hours of debugging deadlocked production systems."

```typescript
/**
 * DAG-Based Workflow Validation
 *
 * Problem: Circular dependencies between agents cause silent deadlocks.
 * Agent A → B → C → A creates an infinite wait with no error.
 * In production, this manifests as "the system just hangs" with
 * no logs, no errors, and confused users.
 *
 * Solution: Parse agent dependencies into a DAG. Run topological
 * sort before execution. If a cycle exists, reject the workflow
 * immediately with a clear error showing the cycle path.
 *
 * Interview Defense: "We validate every workflow as a DAG before
 * execution. Cycle detection costs 0.1ms and prevents silent
 * deadlocks that would otherwise take hours to debug in production."

//
// → researcher and coder run in parallel (Group 1)

// → reviewer runs last (Group 3)

// Example: Circular dependency (HARD STOP)
//
// const invalid = validateWorkflowDAG([
//   { agentId: 'researcher',  dependsOn: ['reviewer'] },  // ← cycle!
//   { agentId: 'writer',      dependsOn: ['researcher'] },

// Result: {
//   valid: false,

//     researcher → writer → reviewer → researcher"
// → Fix the workflow before any agent fires
```

3. **No Conflict Resolution**: What happens when agents disagree?
   - **Fix**: Implement arbitration (see Week 11, Conflict Resolution)

4. **Ignoring Latency**: Sequential can be too slow for users
   - **Fix**: Use parallel where possible, show progress indicators

## Real-World Example

**Task**: Generate a technical blog post with code examples

```typescript
async function createTechnicalBlogPost(topic: string) {
  const manager = new ManagerAgent([researcher, coder, writer, reviewer])

  // Manager automatically:
  // 1. Has researcher find information (30s)
  // 2. Has coder create examples (parallel, 25s)
  // 3. Has writer create draft with research + code (20s)
  // 4. Has reviewer check quality (15s)
  // 5. Has writer revise if needed (15s)

  const post = await manager.delegateTask({
    description: `Technical blog post about ${topic}`,
    requirements: ['accurate', 'code examples', 'beginner friendly']
  })

  return post
}

// Total time: ~90 seconds (with parallelization)
// Total cost: ~$0.40
// Quality: High (multiple review stages)
```

## Architect Challenge: The Specialist vs. Generalist Quiz

**You are designing a multi-agent system for an investment firm. The CEO wants an "AI Analyst" that produces weekly investment reports.**

**The Situation:**

Each report requires: (1) **Market Research** — scanning 50+ sources for sector trends, (2) **Financial Modeling** — running DCF valuations on 10 stocks, (3) **Risk Assessment** — evaluating geopolitical and regulatory risks, and (4) **Report Writing** — producing a polished 20-page PDF. The current single-agent approach takes **45 minutes** and costs **$2.80 per report**. The CFO wants to scale from 10 reports/week to 200 reports/week. The current architecture won't survive.

**Your options:**

**A)** Use a **single powerful agent** (Opus) with a massive prompt that includes all instructions for research, modeling, risk, and writing. Give it web search, calculator, and PDF tools. Scale by running 200 sequential requests.

**B)** Deploy a **Supervisor-Specialist Pattern**. One lightweight Supervisor agent (Haiku) decomposes each report request into 4 sub-tasks, dispatches them to 4 specialized agents (Research-Sonnet, Finance-Sonnet, Risk-Haiku, Writer-Sonnet), validates the DAG for dependency cycles, collects results via Egress Hand-offs (500-token summaries), and synthesizes the final report.

**C)** Use **Choreography** with event-driven agents. Each agent listens for events and publishes results. No central coordinator — agents self-organize through a message bus.

**D)** Fine-tune a single model on 500 example reports so it can do everything in one call without multiple agents.

### Correct Answer: B — Supervisor-Specialist Pattern

An Architect uses **Supervisor-Specialist** for transactional, multi-skill workflows where quality and auditability matter.

**The Math:**

```typescript
// Current: Single agent (Opus)
//   Time per report: 45 minutes
//   Cost per report: $2.80
//   200 reports/week sequential: 150 hours (impossible)
//   200 reports/week parallel: 200 × $2.80 = $560/week

// Supervisor-Specialist Pattern:
//   Supervisor (Haiku): $0.02 per dispatch
//   Research Agent (Sonnet): $0.35 (parallel, 8 min)
//   Finance Agent (Sonnet): $0.40 (parallel, 10 min)
//   Risk Agent (Haiku): $0.08 (parallel, 3 min)
//   Writer Agent (Sonnet): $0.30 (sequential after others, 5 min)
//   Egress summaries: 4 × $0.01 = $0.04
//
//   Total per report: $1.19
//   Time per report: max(8, 10, 3) + 5 = 15 minutes (67% faster)
//   200 reports/week: 200 × $1.19 = $238/week (58% cheaper)
//   Annual savings: (560 - 238) × 52 = $16,744
```

**Why other answers fail:**

- **A) Single powerful agent** — Opus at $2.80/report × 200 = $560/week. No parallelism within each report (45 min each). At 200 reports, you need 150 hours of sequential processing per week. Even with parallel instances, you're paying 2.4x more than the Specialist pattern and getting no quality improvement from specialization.

- **C) Choreography** — Investment reports are **transactional workflows** that need audit trails. The CFO needs to know exactly which agent produced which section for compliance. Choreography makes this nearly impossible to trace. When the Risk Agent produces a wrong assessment, you need the Supervisor's central log to identify and fix it. Choreography is for streaming pipelines, not auditable financial documents.

- **D) Fine-tune a single model** — Violates the **Behavior vs. Memory** rule. Market data changes daily. A fine-tuned model would confidently report last month's stock prices. Fine-tuning teaches behavior (format, tone), not facts (market data). The report would look polished but contain stale, hallucinated numbers — the worst possible outcome for an investment firm.

**The Architect's Principle:** "Supervisor-Specialist is the default for **business-critical, multi-skill workflows**. The Supervisor provides auditability (every sub-task is logged), rollback (re-run just the failed agent), and cost control (use cheap models for simple sub-tasks, expensive models only where quality demands it). The 500-token Egress Hand-off between agents prevents context bloat. The DAG validation prevents deadlocks. This is not just a pattern — it's an **operating system for AI workflows**."
